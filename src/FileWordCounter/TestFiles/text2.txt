Hello, how are you? I hope everything is going well. Yesterday, I went to the park and saw many beautiful 
flowers. They were of various colors: red, blue, and yellow. I took some photos; maybe I'll share them later. 
Suddenly, a bird flew by! It was so fast, and I couldn't capture it on camera. I wonder where it went. Anyway,
let's meet for coffee tomorrow; what do you think? Call me when you're free! (I'll be waiting).
